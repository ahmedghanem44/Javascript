<!-- 5.	Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!
Write a function named calculateSupply that:
takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
Call that function three times, passing in different values each time. -->
